# linear-rustgebra
linear algebra library written entirely in rust

this shouldnt be used in any serious setting since it is very slow because of my use of Vec<Vec<f64>>. the main purpose of this project was to program some linear algebra algorithms.

a faster solution would be to use an array of size length*width.
